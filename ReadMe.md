## Project Overview

This project is a simple authentication application that showcases the integration of a React and TypeScript frontend with a Spring MVC backend. It features:

- A login form built with React and TypeScript.
- Backend user authentication logic using Spring MVC.
- Full setup for linting and code formatting with ESLint and Prettier.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Webpack**: A module bundler to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter to enforce consistent code style.

### Backend

- **Spring MVC**: A model-view-controller framework for building Java-based web applications.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used for managing project dependencies.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
